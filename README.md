# custom-ecommerce-events-pixel
This code maps e-commerce events from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to corresponding events for Facebook Pixel. It uses an obj object where each GA4 event matches its equivalent event in Facebook Pixel.

However, there are a few points for improvement:

Checking if the event is not found in the object: To avoid errors if the event is not listed in the object, a validation check can be added.

Variable name recommendation: The customEventsFacebook variable in the comment suggests that this variable should already be created in Google Tag Manager (GTM). It would be helpful to clarify that it should be declared.
